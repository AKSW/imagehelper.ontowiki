# Image Helper Extension

Rewrites a given value of a resource to an image URL and displays this image in a module.

## Usage

The module will show images in the right box, if they are outlined as resources using one of the following properties:
* http://vocab.ub.uni-leipzig.de/bibrm/eissn
* http://vocab.ub.uni-leipzig.de/bibrm/pissn

So, in case you want to facilitate the module, add new properties to your resource(s) using one of mentioned URIs of the list.
